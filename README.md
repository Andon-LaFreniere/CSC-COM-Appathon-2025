## The Idea (Brief)

We’ll integrate an AI model with the app for the final demo to generate reports based on patient health history with some functional features in the app, that can enhance patient engagement.

## The Idea (Expanded)

Proposal: Visual Health Insight App for Patients and Providers

In the U.S., medication nonadherence contributes to approximately 125,000 deaths and 25% of hospitalizations annually. While at least 80% medication adherence is needed for optimal health outcomes, only about 50% of patients with chronic conditions adhere to their treatment plans [1]. Understanding personal health history and medication impact remains a challenge for many patients, despite receiving printed summaries from healthcare providers or other communication tools. This often leads to poor comprehension, reduced engagement, and less effective treatments.
We propose an app that can integrate with existing EHR systems and visually map a patient’s health history and medication usage onto a human body diagram. By using color-coded markers based on condition severity and medication categories, the app offers a visual summary of a patient’s overall health. The visual format enhances communication, supports better decision-making, and encourages more informed patient engagement.
For patients, the app provides an interactive view of their conditions, the role of medications, and associated body parts, along with educational content on drug purpose, side effects, and expected outcomes. Patients can rate medication experiences, tracking the effectiveness of their adherence and adverse effects over time.
For doctors, this visual summary supports faster, informed decision-making. For researchers and pharmaceutical companies, anonymized data on drug usage, outcomes, and side effects can offer valuable insights into real-world treatment efficacy.
The initial prototype will focus on lifestyle diseases like diabetes and hypertension, mapping history, medication use, and progress. Aiming to improve adherence by 20%, this scalable platform will expand to complex conditions, revolutionizing personalized care.
